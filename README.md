### What I learned

I learnt a lot in doing this project. It took me about 2.5 hours to complete this project. I faced a lot of roadblocks doing this, sometime media queries not working, sometimes facing issues with flexbox layout but I learned a lot solving those. Espescially, I didn't have the idea on how to change my image with media queries , tried changing backgrounds in vain and then finally tried the idea of toggling classes I learned in js tutorials to modify it and use it in CSS. All in all, It was a good learning time and is helping me build my self confidence in web development.
